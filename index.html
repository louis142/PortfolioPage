                Welcome to my webpage! 
                My name is Louis Navarro and I am a second year computer science student. 
                Learning new skills is something I always endeavour to do which is why I have decided to create this webpage. 
                Web development is an area in which I have limited experience, and so if you will join me, you will be able to observe tinkering and modifications I make to the page as I learn new skills and techniques.
                Thank you for visiting!

            <h2>True Picture</h2>
            <p>
                Console app for students and tutors to bridge the gap on mental health. 
                The project had a particular focus on how the app was being developed reinforcing techniques like identifying personas and user stories to build a portfolio of who would be using the app and their requirements.

            <h2>Web Server</h2>
            <p>
                Designing a web client from the ground up, starting with the SQL database and moving on to a program that handles http network requests to that table.
                This project involved a lot of moving parts from understanding how to normalise my database to coding each of the catch cases for a bad request.

            <h2>Neural Network vs Regression Model</h2>
            <p>
                Weighing the performance and accuracy of several AI models.
                Considering factors like over-fitting and under-fitting, allowing me to understand the mechanisms and limits of these models to select the best for the job.

            <h2>Cinema ePOS</h2>
            <p>
                Console App for a cinema that handles transactions and movie screenings.
                The process of building the project instilled many object oriented principles allowing me to experience the necessity of them, such as inheritance, through problem solving.

            <h2>Network Management On The Cloud</h2>
            <p>
                Building a virtual network with accompanying virtual machines on Azure to understand the significance of network security systems.
                Deciding the security levels and using network utility tools to determine if each machine is secure enough taught me to consider scenarios which would leave the whole network vulnerable.

                Developing a mock prototype for an electric bike company with an accompanying app.
                Strengthening team skills and encouraging open dialogue to develop a team pitch we are all proud of.

                Outside of computer science I am a huge movie buff. 
                Watching movies from all across the world provide such varying perspectives it's impossible to finish without taking a lesson away.
                Some of my personal favourite cinema comes from India, I'm in love with the bright upbeat item numbers as well as the over the top action.                
            </p>
            <p>
                I think it is also important to get out and see the world around and so I try to go out on my bike or take a stroll if I can fit in the time. 
                I always have some energy I need to expel and so if a walk doesn't do it I like to go to gym.
                After all, healthy body healthy mind.
            </p>
            <p>            
                When I'm not studying or working on a project I like to play video games, it's pretty cliche I know.
                I like the competition and challenge of learning a new games techniques and seeing the progression almost makes all the frustration worth it.
                Please do feel free to recommend me some new games!
