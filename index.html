                [2026/01/24]Welcome to my webpage! 
                My name is Louis Navarro and I am a second year computer science student. 
                Learning new skills is something I always endeavour to do which is why I have decided to create this webpage. 
                Web development is an area which I have limited experience, and so if you will join me in my pursuit of building a digital portfolio you will be able to observe all the alteration and modifications I make to the page with the end goal of displaying all my accomplishments.
                Thank you for visiting!
